# imageProcessing
This repository contains multiple files that contains codes and programs which are exercises from a course called image Processing (Bildverarbeitung), which is in the my third semester of my studies. In this course we learned about how manipulate pixels to create a certain filter, effect, transformation, building a histogram to collect data and analyse it, etc. All using Java and its framework

first exersice was about creating Gaussian filter after converting the picture to gray pixels, The implementation challenge is that we need to implement a filter with a variable kernel size.
second exersice was about creating a geometric image transformation effect and to learn about speed optimization in image processing. Knowledge of the methods of pixel repetition and bilinear interpolation learned in the Basics of Digital Media course, which is in my GDM repositort are used here.
third exercise we implemented the basic morphological filters Dilation and Erosion and their combination Opening and Closing for processing binary images.
in the fourth exercise we created an application capable of analyzing an image by displaying its key characteristics by drawing a histogram and analyze its change under elementary image manipulations. we also learned how to use the JavaFX graphics context to display drawings.
the fifth exercise was a completion of the fourth exercise, to analyse the data.
last exericse was about reconstructing an image for a better  compression ratios. we created a JavaFX application that encodes and reconstructs an image using DPCM.
